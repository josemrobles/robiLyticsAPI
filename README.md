# Golang Jira user info app
This app uses the Jira API to obtain statistics on a developer or a set of developers. Statistics include number of open tasks, number of accepted tasks, number of rejected tasks, etc. In addition there is a progress bar that factors the number of accepted tasks verses the total amount of tasks.
